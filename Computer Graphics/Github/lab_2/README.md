Project2 in Three js
Ioannis Manousaridis

I implemented the followings:

- There are three spotlights. One stable, one with changing color and one moving.
- There is a cube with colourful sides and its shadow casts at
  the sphere.
- There is a jumping, moving and colour changing sphere.
- There is a jumping and rotating transparent cylinder whose position is according to the first spotlight.
- I added a Cone3D object. It's a cone with eyes. It's moving
  and rotating.

 
## TODO  
- Add a gltf object but I couldn't do it till now.
